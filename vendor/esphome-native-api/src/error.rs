//! Error types for the ESPHome native API.
//!
//! The API distinguishes errors by *what a consumer would do differently* about
//! them rather than by where they occurred:
//!
//! - [`Error::Disconnected`] — the session ended. This is the normal way a
//!   connection terminates; most consumers treat it as informational, not a
//!   failure.
//! - [`FrameError::UnknownMessageType`] — a valid frame carrying a message type
//!   this build does not know (e.g. a newer ESPHome release). It is safe to skip
//!   and keep the connection alive; the read loop does exactly that internally.
//! - Every other [`FrameError`] / [`HandshakeError`] / [`Error::Io`] variant is a
//!   genuine fault that tears the connection down.
